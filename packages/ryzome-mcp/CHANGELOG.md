# @ryzome-ai/ryzome-mcp

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 67eb75f: Align canvas reads with resource access states and add reference nodes, explicit layout,
  caller-supplied IDs, provenance, canvas updates, structural inspection, bearer authentication,
  and structured results. Preserve parallel edges, validate identity collisions before writes,
  and avoid replaying ambiguous canvas mutations. Keep adapter diagnostics and results aligned.

  Respect explicit dimensions in legacy layout spacing and send image-node canvas mutations only once.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [67eb75f]
  - @ryzome-ai/ryzome-core@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5717d0e: Fix document and canvas listing for the current API metadata response envelope, including BSON timestamps. Send tags and pinned filters, preserve favorite summaries, and report invalid responses with their HTTP status instead of retrying them as network failures.

  Add tools to create, inspect, and update bundles of documents, and allow filtering document lists by Bundle content type. Keep adapter manifests synchronized with the shared tools.

- e328aeb: Add conversation and message tools now that the backend conversation routes accept API key authentication: create, read, list, search, update, append messages to, and delete Ryzome conversations. Add MCP conversation resources and keep adapter manifests synchronized with the shared tools.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 2c39852: Internal cleanup and code quality pass across the plugin monorepo.

  - `ryzome-core`: tighten `RyzomeClient.getCanvas` / `listCanvases` return types and drop redundant `try/catch` wrappers in tool executors so `RyzomeApiError` propagates directly.
  - `ryzome-mcp`: advertise the server version from `package.json` (no more hardcoded `0.2.0`), share a `resourceIdToString` helper, and clean up stale inline comments.
  - `openclaw-ryzome`: move `@sinclair/typebox` to `devDependencies` (it is only used for type generation at build time) and sync README tool/command tables with the current tool surface.
